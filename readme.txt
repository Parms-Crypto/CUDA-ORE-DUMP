CUDA add-on for ORE mining, this is bare bones. But if you know what you're doing very easy!

You will have to add dependencies and modifications for your specific use case! 

Bare-bones due to the fact $ORE dev has no clue what they are doing and already changing token to a new version.

Keep up to date since more complete updates will drop when $ORE drop new version 2 code.

No I'm not ignorant and going to drop my top 1% miner advantageous full suite. I may drop the full cuda miner suite when my ASIC write up is complete. 
I will always be one step ahead of what I release.

This drop is to all the trolls in $ORE community larping as miners that don't even understand basics.

Maybe take some time to learn PoW mining and basic gametheory. Years and years of proven research by the best in the field.
Yet, you think you "know it all" and going to prove them all wrong? OK, bet!

Good luck "small miners" your leader pushed you to your own death, you now have REAL MINERS opposition against your project!
The $ORE hashrate does not provide any network security (there is no 51% attack vectors, no confirming blocks/orphans, no confirming the longest chain) 
nor does it effect the $ORE reward rate of 1 ore/min, increasing difficulty just feeds us professional miners to eat your liquidity. 

Also good to note that hardhatchad gives no care about the enviroment by wasting electricity by increasing difficulty for no other reason than
complete ignorance and refusal to do adequate research. On a mission to make "futarchy" some buzzward but raises difficulty instead of reducing rewards?
You really can't make all this up : complete ignorance, pushing absolute misinformation and misunderstanding of nearly everything. Also don't forget the sudden 
changes in the mission to make the spam trolls happy. Just harrass/spam him enough and you'll get what you want.

More hash = more wallets to mine without any speed losses due to computational restraints on CPU which is the weakest form of mining 

1 GH is 1 billion hashes per a second. GPU can solve 4x difficutly so far in under 3 ms on 172 instances (and counting) simultaneously with no effort.

Miner PoW history will not be broken by $ORE traders larping as miners CPU -> GPU -> FPGA -> ASIC

-SIDE-NOTE-
I have a mining pool front end suite I may drop to help push big mining farms. Maybe once ASIC come online
I'll start it up.  Might as well take a cut giving "small miners" an opportunity. Mobile and phone mining will be impossible soon
and rewards will scale to 0.000000001 a hit.

WARNING!!! IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING BURNING UP YOUR GPU IS YOUR OWN ISSUE
YOUR SUITE WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR UNDERCLOCKING AND REQUIRE IN DEPTH GPU MINING KNOWLEDGE, 
IM NOT HERE TO HOLD PEOPLES HANDS NOR AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR FAILURES!

1. Setup and Compile Cuda

https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

* cuDNN may be advantageous additional option for some

2. Rust dependency/bindings

3. Modify for your miner and build

4. mine and dump all profit

5. Win!
